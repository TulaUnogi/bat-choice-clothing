## UX design


### Overview

In the initial phase of this project I designed a broad set of wireframes and mockups covering most of the features and screen sizes to help me decide on the structure, design and layout of the website before entering the coding stage. To help me with this task I used [Justinmind](https://www.justinmind.com/).

#### Design

> Name and Logo 

At first I needed to decide on the website's purpose, name and logo. As I wanted to create a goth/alternative online thrift shop, something related to the vampires, coffins or bats were the first things that came to my mind. In the end I chose to make the word play of "Bat Choice" and picked a bat's head as a part of the logo.
To design my logo I used a free logo maker available at https://app.logo.com/.

> Typography

I decided on using two main fonts available through Google Fonts:

- [Megrim](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Megrim) for logo, headings and buttons
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for the rest of the website.

> Colour palete

When you think of the word "goth" you most likely picture something dark and moody. And so is the colour palette I decided on. I used the mix of black, white, grey and my favourite shade of purple to summon the dark, yet feminine vibes.
To better visualise it I used [this colour palette generator](https://coolors.co/):

- A teenage/ adult thrift store/ vintage lovers
- A person who likes goth fashion and aesthetic

#### Goals for the website

- To allow Users to browse through multiple clothing categories, so they can find the products they're interested in
- To help Customers access more sustainable clothing options
- To keep User's data safe
