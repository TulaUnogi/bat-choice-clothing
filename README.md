## E-Commerce

### Purpose

Three core ideas behind BatChoice would be the following:

> Ease of use 

Simple and comfortable way for customers to browse through second hand gothic and alternative style clothing.

> Reliability 

Providing a single trustworthy and quality checked point for these pieces of clothing.

> Sustainability

Helping customers towards making good and enviromentally friendly fashion choices.

All of which combined, with a community focused on aestethic and quality, shall provide a standing ground for future growth. 
Possibly even into international spaces.

### Business Model and Marketing

#### Business Model

Bat Choice Clothing has a plan on providing sustainable high quality used and vintage alternative style clothes and footwear for our online customers.
Due to being a small online business and using a storage space based in Founder's private place the company would save on the high costs of renting a retail unit in a city. The savings generated through that would be spent towards better quality clothing sourced locally from thrift and vintage shops, flea markets, car boot sales, internet auctions (in some cases) and wholesalers.
Product pricing would vary between the items depending on their style, brand and condition. Providing users with a good reselling value by continous online research to ensure appropriate market price match and prevent overpricing will build the company's trust within the thrifting community and carefully curated collections will make it stand out amongst the competitors like Depop, Ebay or Amazon.
Business would mainly focus around female customers aged 16+, interested in goth, punk, emo and other styles within the wide spectrum of alternative fashion, music and lifestyle. After Bat Choice Clothing becomes a recognisable brand in the Internet, the product range would expand to include also male clothing and accessories to attract a broader audience. The "big picture" future plan includes engaging the local goth micro-brands to sell their arts and crafts on Bat Choice Clothing's website to share the spirit of creativity and upcycling.
With the goth and alternative community growing rapidly within the past few years altogether with society's increasing environmental awareness and vintage clothes simply being "in" there are high hopes for this company's big success.

#### Marketing

The initial starting points for getting grounded, would be advertising through various forms of Social Media. 
Obvious choices for visibility would be Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. However, spreading out and creating tendrils on other platfroms such as Tiktok would only help with visibility as well as providing website traffic and growth at a future date. 

Once a presence has been established on these platforms, and users have begun registering themselves to the site, we plan on keeping them informed and updated on everything Bat-Choice through a newsletter system. To avoid avoid coming across or being seen as spam, these 'newsletters' should be rolled out on a semi-regular basis. The key insights we would want to provide should show our users updates on currently stocked lines, seasonal discounting, stock highlights or even aspects of the growth/changes of the business and charity events and organisations supported by Bat Choice Clothing.

## UX design


### Overview

In the initial phase of this project I designed a broad set of wireframes and mockups covering most of the features and screen sizes to help me decide on the structure, design and layout of the website before entering the coding stage. To help me with this task I used [Justinmind](https://www.justinmind.com/).

#### Design

> Name and Logo 

At first I needed to decide on the website's purpose, name and logo. As I wanted to create a goth/alternative online thrift shop, something related to the vampires, coffins or bats were the first things that came to my mind. In the end I chose to make the word play of "Bat Choice" and picked a bat's head as a part of the logo.
To design my logo I used a free logo maker available at https://app.logo.com/.

> Typography

I decided on using two main fonts available through Google Fonts:

- [Megrim](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Megrim) for logo, headings and buttons
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for the rest of the website.

> Colour palete

When you think of the word "goth" you most likely picture something dark and moody. And so is the colour palette I decided on. I used the mix of black, white, grey and my favourite shade of purple to summon the dark, yet feminine vibes.
To better visualise it I used [this colour palette generator](https://coolors.co/):

<img src="readme-images/colour-palette.png" alt="Colour palette">

#### Site User

- A woman looking for an alternative clothing online store
- A person looking for sustainable clothing options available without leaving their house
- A teenage/ adult thrift store/ vintage lovers
- A person who likes goth fashion and aesthetic

#### Goals for the website

- To allow Users to browse through multiple clothing categories, so they can find the products they're interested in
- To help Customers access more sustainable clothing options
- To keep User's data safe
- To make the shopping process intuitive and simple, and to ensure that the payment system is secure
- To have a clear marketing strategy and good SEO
- To be accessible
- To answer potential questions raised by customers

## Agile Development

### Overview

This project has been started alongside GitHub Projects to plan and track the workflow which would help me to manage the expected workload. After setting out the milestones and epics for my project I broke them down into a set of user stories and smaller tasks, which helped me monitor my progress and finish all of the mandatory features. Outside of user stories I also included separate issues for creating each module of this README file, to help me keep on track with documentation. To see the project's Kanban page please click [here](https://github.com/users/TulaUnogi/projects/4)


#### User Stories

Initial stage of the project included UX planning. I thought about the features and functionality I would expect from the first uses of the website and based on that I created a set of 14 User Stories. I labelled 12 of them as mandatory and the on, as they provide the core functionality and source of important informations for the User. The remaining 2 Stories are labelled as NINTH- Nice To Have, Not Important, as they provide some improvements, but are not necessary for the User to enjoy the website's base functionality. 

The User Stories include the acceptance criteria and are broken down into smaller, bite- size tasks that I would tick on completion, so I could easily track my progress. During the coding session I would record the encountered bugs, issues and solutions related to the Story in the comments below. Once all of the tasks in the Issue are completed I would move the User Story form "In progress" to "Completed" card in my project's Kanban.

- Select "Create App"
- In the "Deploy" tab choose GitHub as the deployment method
- Connect your GitHub account/ find and connect your GitHub repository

> Set up enviroment variables

- In the Django app editor create env.py in the top level
- In env.py import os
- In env.py set up necessary enviroment variables:
  - add a secret key using: os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your secret key'
  - in settings.py replace value of SECRET_KEY variable with os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
  - in settings.py change the DATABASES to:
  ```
  if "DATABASE_URL" in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
        }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
  ```
- In Django app's settings.py on top of the file add:
```
from pathlib import Path
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env
```

- Set up [Amazon AWS S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- Install django-storages and boto3
- Navigate to the "Settings" tab in Heroku.
- Open the "Config Vars" section and add DATABASE_URL as Key and the database link as Value
- Add SECRET_KEY for the Key value and the secret key value from env.py as the Value
- Set variable "USE_AWS" to "True"
- Add AWS bucket "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" and "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" and set their values (downloaded from S3 AWS)
- In custom_storages.py:
```
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

```
- In the terminal migrate the models over to the new database connection
- In settings.py add the STATIC files settings as follows:
```
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = (os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),)

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:

    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'ckz8780-boutique-ado'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
- Change the templates directory in settings.py to: TEMPLARES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
- In TEMPLATES variable change the 'DIRS' key to look like this: 'DIRS': [TEMPLARES_DIR],
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list (the format will be your-app-name.herokuapp.com, you can copy it from the Domains section in Settings tab in your Heroku app)
- If you haven't done that up to this point, then create in your Django app's code editor new top level folders: static and templates
- Create a new file on the top level directory - Procfile, remembering to use a capital letter
- Within the Procfile add following:
```
web: guincorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi
``` 
- In the terminal, add the changed files, commit and push to GitHub

> Heroku deployment

- In Heroku, navigate to the Deployment tab and deploy the branch manually 
- Heroku will display a build log- watch the build logs for any errors
- Once the build process is completed Heroku displays 'Your App Was Successfully Deployed' message and a link to the app to visit the live site
